# Tata GenAI Powered Data Analytics – Collections Strategy Project

This repository contains my end-to-end work for the **Tata GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage – Sept 2025)**.  
The project demonstrates how **data analytics, predictive modeling, and agentic AI** can be applied to design a responsible, scalable **collections strategy for Geldium Financial Services**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project was approached step by step:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand data quality, identify missing values, and explore delinquency risk factors.  
2. **Predictive Modeling Framework:** Propose model types, evaluation metrics, and risk segmentation.  
3. **Business Report & Recommendations:** Translate predictive insights into SMART, actionable strategies for collections.  
4. **AI-Powered Collections System:** Design an agentic AI-driven workflow, guardrails, and business impact framework.

## 📝 Tasks Completed

I structured the work into **four main tasks**, building step by step from raw data to a fully automated AI-powered collections framework.

### **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Explored the **Delinquency Prediction Dataset** (500 rows, 19 variables).  
- Cleaned the data: identified missing income values, validated utilization ratios.  
- Analyzed distributions and correlations to spot **key risk factors**.  
- **Findings:**  
  - High credit utilization strongly linked to delinquency.  
  - Debt-to-Income ratio (DTI) and repayment history are critical predictors.  
  - Some anomalies: delinquent customers with higher credit scores/income, showing behavior-driven risks.  

📄 Deliverable: *EDA Summary Report*  

---

### **Task 2: Predictive Modeling Framework**
- Designed a framework for **predicting customer delinquency**.  
- Selected candidate models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
- Defined evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score (to balance false negatives).  
- Integrated **business rules + model outputs** to classify customers into risk tiers (Low / Medium / High).  

📄 Deliverable: *Model Plan Report*  

---

### **Task 3: Business Report & Recommendations**
- Translated technical findings into a **stakeholder-friendly report**.  
- Built **SMART recommendations** based on predictive insights.  
  - Example:  
    *“Launch a 6-week SMS outreach pilot for customers under 30 with 2+ missed payments, aiming to reduce 30-day delinquency by 10%.”*  
- Addressed **ethical AI considerations**: fairness, explainability, compliance, and human-in-the-loop safeguards.  

📄 Deliverable: *Business Summary Report*  

---

### **Task 4: AI-Powered Collections System**
- Designed a high-level concept for an **agentic AI system** to automate collections.  
- **System Workflow:**  
  1. Inputs: customer demographics, repayment history, credit utilization, income, credit score.  
  2. Decision Logic: risk score + business rules.  
  3. Actions: reminders, hardship support offers, escalation for high risk.  
  4. Learning Loop: track outcomes, retrain models, optimize outreach.  
- Defined **Autonomous vs Human Oversight** roles.  
- Built slides covering:  
  - How the system works  
  - Role of agentic AI  
  - Responsible AI guardrails  
  - Expected business impact  
  - Implementation roadmap  
  - Success metrics & monitoring  

📄 Deliverable: *AI-Powered Collections System Presentation*

## ✅ Final Outcomes

- Identified **top 3 risk drivers**: Credit Utilization, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Payment History.  
- Developed a **predictive framework** to score customers by delinquency risk.  
- Produced a **business-ready report** with actionable, SMART recommendations.  
- Designed a **responsible AI-powered collections system** with fairness, transparency, and compliance guardrails.  
- Delivered an **executive presentation** outlining workflow, impacts, and roadmap.

## 📊 Business Impact

**Quantitative Benefits:**  
- 10–15% reduction in delinquency rates.  
- Lower operational costs via automation.  
- Higher repayment recovery with targeted outreach.  

**Qualitative Benefits:**  
- Transparent and fair treatment of customers.  
- Personalized, supportive collections strategies.  
- Improved customer trust and long-term loyalty.
